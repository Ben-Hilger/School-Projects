                <td> <p> My name is Benjamin Hilger and I'm a computer science major at Miami University.
				I am currently a first year student with an expected graduation date in May 2023. I enjoy programming and have an interest in IOS apps. 
				I also participate in the Miami University Marching Band and play at all home football games and played at OSU and UC this year. 
				I play basketball with my brother in the summer and I also participate in Kode2Learn, AIAA, and plan to join Engineers without Borders or the ACM association in the coming weeks. 
				I am also pursuing a project called "Lesson Notebook" and have been developing it for a couple weeks. I've really enjoyed my time here at Miami so far, the professors and fellow students
				are all amazing people and are becoming life long friends! The local offerings are also great Uptown, with Buffalo Wild Wings currently being my favorite place to go out to eat.
				I'm excited with registration coming up and hope I can get all of the classes I want, I have about 5 different sschedules as backups. For housing next year I hope to get into Withrow or StonebridgeLife
				depending on if I continue in the marching band. So many oppurtunitie so life is great!! </p> </td>
