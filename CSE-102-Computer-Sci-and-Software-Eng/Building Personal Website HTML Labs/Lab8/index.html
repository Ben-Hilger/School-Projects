                <td> <p> My name is Benjamin Hilger and I'm a computer science major at Miami University. I am currently a first year student with an expected graduation date in May 2023. I enjoy programming and have an interest in IOS apps. I also participate in the Miami University Marching Band and play at all home football games and played at OSU and UC this year. I play basketball with my brother in the summer and I also participate in Kode2Learn, AIAA, and plan to join Engineers without Borders or the ACM association in the coming weeks. I am also pursuing a project called "Lesson Notebook" and have been developing it for a couple weeks. Life is great!! </p> </td>
